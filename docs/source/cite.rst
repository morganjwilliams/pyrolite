If you use :mod:`pyrolite` extensively for your research, citation of the software
would be particularly appreciated. It helps quantify the impact of the project
(assisting those contributing through paid and volunteer work), and is one way to get
the message out and help build the pyrolite community.

.. note:: :mod:`pyrolite` began as a personal project, but as the project develops
          there are likely to be other contributors. Check the
          `Contributors list <./contributors.html>`__ and add major contributors as
          authors. A `CITATION.cff file <https://github.com/morganjwilliams/pyrolite/blob/main/CITATION.cff>`__  
          has also been added to the repository, providing automated citation via GitHub.


:mod:`pyrolite` has been published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS),
and generally this paper is what you should cite. This paper was published in reference
to :mod:`pyrolite` v0.2.7; if you're using a different version please note that in the
citation.

While the exact format of your citation will vary
with wherever you're publishing, it should take the general form:

  Williams et al., (2020). pyrolite: Python for geochemistry.
  Journal of Open Source Software, 5(50), 2314,
  doi: `10.21105/joss.02314 <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02314>`__

Or, if you wish to cite a specific version of the archive:

  Williams et al. (|year|). pyrolite v |version|, Zenodo,
  `doi:10.5281/zenodo.2545106 <https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.5281/zenodo.2545106>`__

If you're after a BibTeX citation for :mod:`pyrolite`, I've added one below.
